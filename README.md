# ljk-luv-fp-foss
Materials for talk on Functional Programming and FOSS for Linux Users of Victoria.

You can produce the current versions of the presentation slides
and notes by running LaTeX on bmr-fp-foss.tex and
art-fp-foss.tex, respectively, assuming you have Beamer installed.

For those without Beamer, I've added product PDF files,
bmr-fp-foss-20161102.pdf and art-fp-foss-20161102.pdf frozen at
the state of my talk to LUV on that date.

My intention was that bmr-fp-foss would be the talk slides, and
art-fp-foss would be the slides augmented with explanatory
notes, both generated from the common source file
body-fp-foss.tex.  But I didn't have time to complete the notes
before the talk.  I probably won't be able to do that until
later in the year.
